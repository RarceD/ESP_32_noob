# ESP_32_noob
This is just some practise about ESP32:

## 1. Bluethoot tecnology

First of all I want to learn everything related with bluethoot tecnology and ESP32 diferent modes.

## 2. Access Point (AP MODE)

The idea is that i can get user info about the hotel guest via a small web page running on the embededded devise.
